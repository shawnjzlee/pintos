======================

Program Overview
-----------------
This is a project for **CS153: Operating Systems** at [UC Riverside](http://ucr.edu), taught by Professor Zhiyun Qian.

Over the course of ten weeks, we will be implementing these into PintOS:

1. threads (**Jan 29, 2016**)

2. user programs (*TBA*)

3. virtual memory (*TBA*)

Installation Guide / How to Use

Currently, this project is **non-collaborative**, as it is a work-in-progress. The copy of any implementations is strictly prohibited.

This repository is meant to practice using version control and track changes to PintOS.
